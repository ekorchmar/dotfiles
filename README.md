# dotfiles
A place for me to store configs for the software I use. Configs are not recommended to be copied as is, as they are tailored to my preferences, including unusual keybindings for QWERTZ keyboard and very, *very* purple color themes.

## Table of Contents
1. [lvim](#lvim)
2. [zshrc](#zshrc)
3. [wezterm](#wezterm)
4. [firefox](#firefox)
5. [starship](#starship)
6. [konsole](#konsole)
7. [bat](#bat)

## lvim
Although I used to have a much longer and comprehensive [.vimrc](https://gist.github.com/ekorchmar/04735e1e280e37899d26b6cc552dd052), I have since switched to LunarVim, to have a managed default and not to have to worry about much. This is the content of my `~/.config/lvim/config.lua` file.

## zshrc
This is my `.zshrc` file. It is a bit of a mess, because it is mostly filled by various initialization scripts from different software. Notably, syntax highlighting are still Dracula colored, because there are few other managed color themes for ZSH.

## wezterm
Nothing special here, just konsole-style shortcuts I was used to.

## firefox
Custom CSS to remove as much clutter from the UI as possible.

## starship
Heavily modified and updated built-in Tokyo Night.

## konsole
This is handcrafted Konsole/Yakuake color scheme, based on [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/enkia/tokyo-night-vscode-theme).

## bat
Makes it a little cleaner from the default. Also uses Dracula for lack of other themes.

## neovide
Just defaults to LunarVim rather than the default Neovim.

## Powershell
Starship prompt & LunarVim alias.

## Lazygit
Slightly bluer color scheme, slightly less visual clutter, Nerdfonts icons.
